     NF2 is a genetically transmitted condition. Diagnosis is most common in early adulthood (20â€“30 years); however, it can be diagnosed earlier. NF2 can be diagnosed due to the presence of a bilateral vestibular schwannoma, or an acoustic neuroma, which causes a hearing loss that may begin unilaterally.[14] If a patient does not meet this criterion of diagnosis, they must have a family history of NF2, and present with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma and other associated tumors (cranial meningioma, cranial nerve schwannoma, spinal meningioma, spinal ependymomas, peripheral nerve tumor, spinal schwannoma, subcutaneous tumor, skin plaque). This being said, more than half of all patients diagnosed with NF2 do not have a family history of the condition.[14] Although it has yet to be included into clinical classification, peripheral neuropathy, or damage to the peripheral nerves, which often causes weakness, numbness and pain in the hands and feet, may also lead to a diagnosis of NF2. In children, NF2 can present with similar symptoms, but generally causes "visual disturbances (cataracts, hamartomas), skin tumors, mononeuropathhy (facial paresis, drop foot), symptomatic spinal cord tumors, or non-vestibular intracranial tumors".
